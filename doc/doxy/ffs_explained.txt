\section ffs_explained_intro Introduction

Rare events, while occuring infrequently, may have important consequences
when they do occur. It is therefore useful to be able to simulate rare
events without wasting a great deal of computational effort on the
"uniteresting" time between these events.

A number of techniques have been developed which attempt to do this
in different contexts. One of these techniques is Forward Flux Sampling
(FFS).
