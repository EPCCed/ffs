\section ffs_explained_background Overview

Rare events, while occurring infrequently, may have important consequences
when they do occur. It is therefore useful to be able to simulate rare
events without wasting a great deal of computational effort on the
"uninteresting" time between these events.

A number of techniques have been developed which attempt to do this
in different contexts. One of these techniques is Forward Flux Sampling
(FFS). There are a number of recent reviews available from a number of
different perspectives of FFS and a range of other methods[1--4].

There are a number of similar approaches to the practical problem
of computing rare events which are broadly independent of the actual
method used for the simulation. These include
[PLUMED](http://www.plumed-code.org/) using a number of techniques
including umbrella sampling for free energy calculations
and [libTPS](http://matforge.org/mol_sim_api/wiki/) for transition
path sampling.
