\section background_intro A rare transition between initial and final states

We consider a system where random (usually thermal) fluctuations can
drive a transition between initial and final states. A characteristic
example is a chemical reaction in which the initial state corresponds
to that containing the reactants and the final state corresponds to
the products. We assume that the reaction involves an activation
barrier which must be overcome in order for reactants to react and
form products. Thermal fluctuations may drive the reaction over the
barrier, a process which will be rare if the barrier height \f$ \Delta E\f$
is large compared with the thermal energy \f$ k_B T \f$.

When the transition is rare, we expect the system to spend a long
time in the initial state, and then make a (relatively) very fast
switch to the final state.
Throughout this description we will refer to the initial state as
"State A" or simply "A", and the final state as "State B" or "B".

In general, for a complex energy landscape, it is impossible to
work out the probability of the reaction (or rate constant) from
first principles. This gives rise to the need for a computational
approach such as forward flux sampling.
