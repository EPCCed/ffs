Configuration
-------------

The build process is based on makl from Koanlogic. Documentation
on makl is available from the
[makl wiki](http://github.com/koanlogic/makl/wiki).

The basic process of configuration and build proceeds as follows
\code
$ makl-conf
$ makl
\endcode
which will provide a minimum sets of options.

If you are doing development, it is also useful to
\code
$ makl depend
\endcode
which will set the dependencies and prevent the need for complete
recompilation.
