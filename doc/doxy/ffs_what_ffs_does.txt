\section ffs_what_overview Overview

In the case where transitions from State A to State B are rare, most
trajectories starting in A will stand little chance of making it to
B with any reasonable computational effort. FFS uses the decomposition
of the progress coordinate, or order parameter, into a series of
interfaces to break the problem down into a series of smaller steps.
The probability of making these smaller steps is much larger than that
of the complete transiation A to B, and we can hope to make incremental
progress between interfaces.

\section ffs_what_init Initial flux and conditional probabilities



Now consider a series of \f$ n \f$ interfaces \f$ \lambda_1 \f$ to
\f$ \lambda_{n} \f$ with \f$ \lambda_{n} = \lambda_B \f$.
We may write the probability that a trajectory
coming from A crosses \f$ \lambda_1 \f$ and reaches \f$ \lambda_2\f$
without returning to A as \f$ P(\lambda_2 | \lambda_1)\f$. The overall
probabilty of getting to \f$ \lambda_{n} \f$ having crossed
\f$ \lambda_1 \f$ and not having returned to A may then be written
\f[
P(\lambda_n | \lambda_1) = \Pi_{i=1}^{n-1} P(\lambda_{i+1} | \lambda_i).
\f]

The overall rate constant \f$ k_{AB} \f$ for getting from A to B is then
the flux at the initial interface multiplied by the conditional
probability of reaching B having started at A, ie.,
\f[
k_{AB} = F(\lambda_1) P(\lambda_n | \lambda_1).
