/**
 *  \mainpage Parallel Forward Flux Sampling

This is a library to help run calculations based on Forward Flux Sampling,
a method which allows one to access rare events via simulation.

In partiuclar, this library is developed with parallel applications using
the message passing interface (MPI) in mind.

This work is funded by the United Kingdom EPSRC under grant EP/I030298/1.
