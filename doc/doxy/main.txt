 *  \mainpage Parallel Forward Flux Sampling

What is Forward Flux Sampling?
------------------------------

Forward Flux Sampling is a method to compute the probability of
rare events based on computer simulation. It works by running
many simulation trials and, based on the result of these trials,
biasing its attempts to those which make progress toward a target.
A more detailed overview is given in the \ref ffs_explained section.
The aim of this library is to provide a framework for undertaking
Forward Flux Sampling calculations.


What is the Parallel bit?
-------------------------
This library is developed with parallel computers and parallel
simulations in mind. To this end is uses the message passing
interface (MPI). If MPI is not available, serial applications
can still be used.

What type of simulation can I run?
----------------------------------

Forward Flux Sampling does nothing by itself. It must be used in
conjunction with a simulation which has a random component. Such
simulations include Monte Carlo, Brownian dynamics, molecular
dynamics with a stochastic thermostat, and others. We provide
examples including dynamic Monte Carlo via the Gillespie algorithm,
and via coupling to the molecular dynamics package LAMMPS.

What do I need to use this library?
-----------------------------------

For the installation instructions, please look at the
\ref ffs_readme_page.
Further information for users is available on the \ref user page.
Further information for
developers is available in the \ref develop section.

Who is responsible?
-------------------

The work was initiated by Rosalind Allen (who developed the method of
Forward Flux Sampling), Juho Lintuvuori, and Kevin Stratford at
[The School of Physics and Astronomy](http://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/) and
[Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre](http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk).
It is funded by the United Kingdom [EPSRC](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/)
under grant EP/I030298/1.
