\section ffs_ex_init Reference state and initial states

In order to make simulation trials from the initial interface, a
number of states at \f$ \lambda_1 \f$ must be generated. This
process also doubles as a mechanism for measuring the number
of trajectories which cross \f$ \lambda_1 \f$ in the forward
direction in unit time (the "forward flux"). This is used to
determine the final probability of the rare event in conjunction
with the conditional probability \f$ P(B|A) \f$.

It is assumed that a single reference state is supplied for
which \f$ \lambda < \lambda_1 \f$ and from which initial trials
are started.

To generate \f$ N_A \f$ states at the initial interface, we fire
exactly \f$ N_A \f$ trials from the reference state. If a number
of these trials fail to reach \f$ \lambda_1 \f$ (e.g., they reach
the maximum time for a trial), the number of initial states will
be less than that requested in the input file. The actual number
is recorded, and used in the proceeding computation. If no trials
reach the initial interface, clearly no further progress can be
made.

The schematic diagram shows a situation where two states \f$ S_1 \f$
and \f$ S_2 \f$ have been generated at the first interface from a
total of three trials from the reference state. The third trial
\f$ t_3 \f$ has not reached the first interface and state \f$ S_3 \f$
cannot be used as the basis of future trials from the first interface.

### Equilibration of the reference state

As the reference state is fixed, it may be necessary to equilibrate
this state in the A basin before starting a trial trajectory. An
equilibration time \f$ t_{eq} \f$ may be defined in the input file.
If, during the equilibration period, the state reaches state B,
the state is re-initialised from the reference state and a new
equilibration is attempted. The equilibration time does not
contribute to the calculation of the flux at the first interface.

### Initial states from a single trajectory

There are a number of different ways of generating the initial
states. The first approach is inherently serial. A single trajectory
is fired from the reference state (after equilibration, if required).
This trajectory is expected to fluctuate about the first interface
\f$ \lambda_1 \f$ as seen in the diagram below. Each forward crossing
of the interface defines a state which, potentially, can be used as
the basis of forward trajectories.

As these states may be close together in state space, it may be desirable
to sub-sample the initial crossing points by skipping every so many states,
or accepting them with some probability. However, all the crossings are
recorded in order to compute the flux at \f$ \lambda_1 \f$.

This method may be used in parallel, in which case each parallel task
computes a single trajectory of its own. However, the results will not
be the same on different numbers of MPI tasks.

### Initial states from parallel trajectories

A parallel alternative may be constructed simply by allowing multiple
trajectories to be used to sample the initial states. In this case,
different trajectories may be computed by different MPI tasks. If the
random number seed for each trajectory is always based on a unique
global trajectory number, the same states will be generated irrespective
of the number of MPI tasks. For the direct FFS variant, some additional
care is required to ensure the same ensemble of states at the first
interface is collected independent of parallel decomposition.

The statistics for the number of crossings and trajectory duration
must be collected at the end of the run to provide a single figure
for the measured flux at \f$ \lambda_1 \f$.
