\section ffs_ex_init Reference state and initial states

In order to make simulation trials from the initial interface, a
number of states at \f$ \lambda_1 \f$ must be generated. Each of these
trials is seeded with a different random number seed so that they
follow a different path. This
process also doubles as a mechanism for measuring the number
of trajectories which cross \f$ \lambda_1 \f$ in the forward
direction in unit time (the "forward flux"). This is used to
determine the final probability of the rare event in conjunction
with the conditional probability \f$ P(B|A) \f$.

It is assumed that a single reference state is supplied for
which \f$ \lambda < \lambda_1 \f$ and from which initial trials
are started.

To generate \f$ N_A \f$ states at the initial interface, we fire
exactly \f$ N_A \f$ trials from the reference state. If a number
of these trials fail to reach \f$ \lambda_1 \f$ (e.g., they reach
the maximum time for a trial), the number of initial states will
be less than that requested in the input file. The actual number
is recorded, and used in the proceeding computation. If no trials
reach the initial interface, clearly no further progress can be
made.

The schematic diagram shows a situation where two states \f$ S_1 \f$
and \f$ S_2 \f$ have been generated at the first interface from a
total of three trials from the reference state. The third trial
\f$ t_3 \f$ has not reached the first interface and state \f$ S_3 \f$
cannot be used as the basis of future trials from the first interface.

\section ffs_ex_eq Equilibration of the reference state

As the reference state is fixed, it may be necessary to equilibrate
this state in the A basin before starting a trial trajectory. An
equilibration time \f$ t_{eq} \f$ may be defined in the input file.
The simulation is run for this time before attempts to identify
initial states at \f$ \lambda_1 \f$ are made.
The equilibration time does not
contribute to the calculation of the flux at the first interface.

Relevant input file parameters are:
\code
        ffs_inst
        {
               init_teq                100.0
               init_nstepmax           10000000
        }
\endcode
which set, respectively, the initial equilibration time \f$ t_{eq}\f$
in simulation units,
and a maximum number of steps (simulation iterations) that the
equilibration will run before timing out. Note that if, at the
end of the equilibration period, the simulation is not in state A
(ie., \f$ \lambda < \lambda_1\f$) a further attempt at equilibration
will be made. If the equilibration fails, it may suggest a poor choice
of initial reference state or initial interface. For problems with
modest barriers, the simulation may enter state B during the
equilibration period, which may suggest \f$ t_{eq}\f$ could be reduced.

\section ffs_ex_init1 Initial states from a single trajectory

There are a number of different ways of generating the initial
states. The first approach is inherently serial. A single trajectory
is fired from the reference state (after equilibration, if required).
This trajectory is expected to fluctuate about the first interface
\f$ \lambda_1 \f$ as seen in the diagram below. Each forward crossing
of the interface defines a state which, potentially, can be used as
the basis of forward trajectories.

![](./init2a.gif "Single trajectory")

As these states may be close together in state space, it may be desirable
to sub-sample the initial crossing points by skipping every so many states,
or accepting them with some probability (or some combination). However,
all the crossings are
recorded in order to compute the flux at \f$ \lambda_1 \f$.

Relevant entries in the input file are:
\code
        ffs_inst
        {
                init_independent        no
                init_ntrials            3
                init_nskip              10
                init_prob_accept        1.0
                init_nsteplambda        1
        }
\endcode
Here, the number of states (and hence initial trials) requested is
3; every tenth crossing of the first interface generates a state,
which is accepted with probability unity. The `init_nsteplambda`
key states that the value of \f$ \lambda \f$ will be computed at
every simulation iteration. If the order parameter itself is
costly to compute, it may be desirable to decrease the frequency.
This will be at the cost of potentially missing some short
fluctuating paths beyond the initial interface.

### Multiple single trajectories

This method may be used in parallel, in which case each parallel task
computes a single trajectory of its own. However, the results will not
be the same on different numbers of MPI tasks. For example, in the
following picture, two MPI tasks are used to generate six initial
states via trajectories \f$ t_1 \f$ and \f$ t_2 \f$. If we ran one
MPI task (trajectory \f$ t_1 \f$ only) to generate six initial states,
the final three would be different.

\section ffs_ex_init2 Initial states from parallel trajectories

A parallel alternative may be constructed simply by allowing multiple
trajectories to be used to sample the initial states. In this case,
different trajectories may be computed by different MPI tasks. If the
random number seed for each trajectory is always based on a unique
global trajectory number, the same states will be generated irrespective
of the number of MPI tasks. In the following picture, four MPI tasks
generate four independent trajectories.

![](./init3.gif "Parallel trajectories")

Note that each independent trajectory undergoes a separate equilibration,
so this method is has the equilibration overhead to be counted for each
one.

The relevant choice in the input file is:
\code
        ffs_inst
        {
                init_independent        yes
        }
\endcode
with the other parameters having the same interpretation as described
above.

\section ffs_init_stats Statistics of the initial crossings


The statistics for the number of crossings and trajectory duration
must be collected at the end of the run to provide a single figure
for the measured flux at \f$ \lambda_1 \f$.

This is measured by recording the number of forward crossings
\f$ N_1 \f$ of the initial interface, and the total simulation
time associated with the
trajectory or trajectories involved \f$ T_1\f$. This
time does not include the equilibration time. The time does
include time spent on fluctuations beyond the initial interface
but not time spent in state B. The flux \f$ F(\lambda_1)\f$ is
then just
\f[
F(\lambda_1) = N_1 / T_1.
\f]
