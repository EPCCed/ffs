\section user_getting_started Getting Started

If you have a successfully compiled version of the library, the
best place to start is probably one of the worked examples,
which provide details of input and output for some simple problems.

There are a number of example simulations available:

- \subpage dmc Simulation of a genetic switch via the Gillespie algorithm

- A simple problem using LAMMPS PENDING

If you want to use a different type of simulation, you should read
the section on ADDING A SIMULATION TYPE.

The order parameter required for a given FFS computation is almost
certainly problem-specific. The library cannot, therefore, anticipate
all possible forms of order parameter for all problems. So, you will
need to understand how to compute
the order parameter at run time using the data available within the
simulation. If you cannot do this, you need to reconsider the problem.

Further, the single-executable model used by the FFS library does not
allow the order parameter to be computed as a separate process, for
example, by saving data to file and then re-reading those data into a
separate program to compute the order parameter. This inevitably
means some additional code will be required to provide a an order
parameter. This is not for the faint-hearted.

If you wish to run the simulation itself in parallel, the
order parameter must be computed in parallel using MPI. Details are
set out in the following section.
If you wish to compute the order parameter in serial, you can still
use multiple independent instances of FFS to gather statistics on the
serial problem.
