This directory contains an example to run a dimer (bonded with double well
potential) problem using FFS library.

To compile lammps with the double well bond please see instructions in 
../../lmp_example/README

To create the restart file (binary) for the FFS test:

(1) $path_to_lammps/lmp_openmpi < dimer.in

This produces dimer.start (a binary restart file).

To test:
(1) mpirun -np #np ../a.out -in dimer.FFS.in -sc none -log none
