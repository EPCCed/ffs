This directory contains an example on dimer problem with LAMMPS as a library:

Directory USER-DW contains the LAMMPS source code for double well potential
V(r) = h*(1 - (x - rwca - w)**2/w**2)**2
This has two minima at r = rwca and r = rwca + 2w, these minima are separated 
by a barrier of height h

To use:
(1) copy the direcory USER-DW to lammps src directory
(2) to install (in lammps src directory) type make yes-USER-DW
(3) to uninstall make no-USER-DW
(4) compile lammps as usual

File double_well_driver.c contains a simple source code to run a dimer problem 
using lammps as a library:

(1) compile lammps as library (in lammps/src): 
    make makelib
    make -f Makefile.lib openmpi
(2) to compile the double_well_driver.c
    change the path in Makefile to point the lammps/src
    make
(3) to run:
    mpirun -np #total_proc ./dw_driver #proc_lammps #nrepeat #step_sample
    eg. for one processor ./dw_driver 1 1000 100

Also included a sample input file and data file for a dimer and 7 solvent (WCA) 
molecules.
Here the double well bond parameters are:
bond_style double_well
bond_coeff   *   3.0 0.25 1.12246152962189
bond_coeff   *   [h] [w]  [rwca]
