This directory contains an example of FFS with dimer problem using LAMMPS plugin

The system is 25 particles: two particles forming the dimer and 23 solven particles interacting Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) potential. The system is 2D.

Directory includes following files:
1) dimer.in - input file to create a starting configuration for FFS
2) dimer.data - initial molecular data
3) dimer.FFS.in - input file for FFS simulation
4) log.lammps.25Jun13 - thermodynamic data produced by the initial simulation
5) bond.dump.25Jun13 - bond lengths for the last 100 steps of the initial 
   simulation at 10 step intervals
6) testrun-inst-0000.log.25Jun13 - result from test ffs simulation

Directory ../lmp_example/USER-DW 
contains the LAMMPS source code for double well potential: 
V(r) = h*(1 - (x - rwca - w)**2/w**2)**2
This has two minima at r = rwca and r = rwca + 2w, these minima are separated 
by a barrier of height h.

To prepare the lammps library :

(1) copy the direcory USER-DW to lammps src directory
(2) to install (in lammps src directory) type
    make yes-molecule
    make yes-USER-DW	
(3) to uninstall:
    make no-USER-DW
(4) compile lammps as usual (in lammps/src):
    
(5) compile lammps as library (in lammps/src): 
     make makelib
    make -f Makefile.lib foo
    where foo is the desired machine name (openmpi, xe6, etc)
(6) compile ffs using instructions in (ffs/README)

The file 'dimer.in' and 'dimer.FFS.in' include the bonding parameters for the
double well potential:

bond_style double_well
bond_coeff   1   15.0 0.5 1.12246152962189
#bond_coeff bond_type h w rwca

The barrier height can be changed via modifying the h parameter. The current 
value (h = 15.0) corresponds to 'holy grail' literature value 
(van Erp, JCP, 118, 7762 (2003)). At this value transition are very infrequent.
Sensible choices are h > 4.0.


To prepare the simulation data:
(1) /path/to/lammps/lammps_executable -in dimer.in

    This will produce following files:
    1) dimer.start - a binary restart file for ffs
    2) log.lammps - thermodynamic output
    3) bond.dump - bond lengths for the last 100 steps of the initial 
       simulation at 10 step intervals

The 'bond.dump' file can be used to easily access the information of the 
current value of bond length ie. the order parameter lambda. The last value 
is the lambda ffs simulations are started from. Thus, if this is value is not 
what is desired further equilibration might be needed. This can be achieved 
by increasing the run variables in dimer.in

To run ffs simulation using the dimer problem using the direct method:
(1) ${path-to-ffs}/src/bin/run lmp_dimer_FFS.inp
