the flux collection run contained 159974956 steps
the run time was 1000000.006351, the number of crossings was 12739, so the flux through the first interface was         0.0127389999
the firing stage (not wih pruning) contained 121912996 steps
the pruning contained 0 steps
the total number of simulation steps was 281887952
interface 0 total weight of successful trials 2730.000000 so forward probability  is 0.27300
interface 1 total weight of successful trials 4949.000000 so forward probability  is 0.49490
interface 2 total weight of successful trials 5797.000000 so forward probability  is 0.57970
interface 3 total weight of successful trials 5241.000000 so forward probability  is 0.52410
interface 4 total weight of successful trials 6437.000000 so forward probability  is 0.64370
interface 5 total weight of successful trials 7488.000000 so forward probability  is 0.74880
interface 6 total weight of successful trials 6855.000000 so forward probability  is 0.68550
interface 7 total weight of successful trials 5715.000000 so forward probability  is 0.57150
interface 8 total weight of successful trials 5415.000000 so forward probability  is 0.54150
interface 9 total weight of successful trials 9296.000000 so forward probability  is 0.92960
interface 10 total weight of successful trials 9934.000000 so forward probability  is 0.99340
interface 11 total weight of successful trials 9973.000000 so forward probability  is 0.99730
final results:
flux through first interface 0.012739 probability of reaching B 0.003866 rate constant 0.000049
