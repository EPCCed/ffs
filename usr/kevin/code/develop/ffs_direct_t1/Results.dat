the flux collection run contained 15907979 steps
the run time was 100000.006901, the number of crossings was 1287, so the flux through the first interface was         0.0128699991
the firing stage (not wih pruning) contained 15899548 steps
the pruning contained 0 steps
the total number of simulation steps was 31807527
interface 0 total weight of successful trials 534.000000 so forward probability  is 0.26700
interface 1 total weight of successful trials 959.000000 so forward probability  is 0.47950
interface 2 total weight of successful trials 1043.333333 so forward probability  is 0.52167
interface 3 total weight of successful trials 885.111111 so forward probability  is 0.44256
interface 4 total weight of successful trials 1133.074074 so forward probability  is 0.56654
interface 5 total weight of successful trials 1439.790123 so forward probability  is 0.71990
interface 6 total weight of successful trials 1301.082305 so forward probability  is 0.65054
interface 7 total weight of successful trials 1128.740741 so forward probability  is 0.56437
interface 8 total weight of successful trials 1124.555556 so forward probability  is 0.56228
interface 9 total weight of successful trials 1858.740741 so forward probability  is 0.92937
interface 10 total weight of successful trials 1999.777778 so forward probability  is 0.99989
interface 11 total weight of successful trials 2007.000000 so forward probability  is 1.00350
final results:
flux through first interface 0.012870 probability of reaching B 0.002321 rate constant 0.000030
