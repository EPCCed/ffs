This directory contains the following:

./BRANCHED_CODE:
Rosalin's original code for branched FFS for Gillespie problem

./DFFS_CODE:
Rosalind's original code for direct FFS for Gillespie problem

./FFS_CODE:
Rosalind's original code for a 2d Ising system with shear. This
version stores some path information based on parent and
random number generator seed.

./REGENERATE:
This takes the path data from the Ising model in ./FFS_CODE and
regenerates a chosen path by rerunning the appropriate simulations.
